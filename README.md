Overseer is a multi purpose, open source discord bot, developed primarily by Proudmuslim#5818. I made this bot as a sort of side project, and as something for other people to base their code off of. 
- The bot is still very much a work in progress, and contributions from others are more than welcome.
- I'm working on getting a proper todo list on this repo, but that will take a bit as I don't have anything planned out properly yet.
- Be sure to follow the license when forking/working on the project

## Requirements:

- Discordpy (latest)
- Aiohttp
- Termcolor
- Jishaku 

All of these can be installed using `pip`.
